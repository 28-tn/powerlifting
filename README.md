# Powerlifting
## Introduction and Motivation
In this repository I analyse the openpowerlifting dataset, a large dataset with powerlifting results from all over the world (see https://www.openpowerlifting.org/data). Powerlifting is a sport where athletes try to lift maximum weights in three different ways (squat, benchpress and deadlift). This is why it is perfectly suitable as a subject for data analysis.

I try to answer the following questions:
* How are performances in squat, deadlift and benchpress related to each other?
* How are these relations affected by gender, age or bodyweight?
* Which is the best age for maximum strength in powerlifting?

## Installations
The following python packages are used in the code:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Math
* Scikit-Learn

You will also need Jupyter to display notebook.

The dataset is too large for a github repository, but you can download it from https://www.openpowerlifting.org/data.

## HowTo
The code and further explanations are arranged in the jupyter notebook.
